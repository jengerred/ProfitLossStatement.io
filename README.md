# Profit and Loss Statement

## Description:
I created this profit and loss statement hoping to update it later to save all the values. This is a simple profit and loss statement. I am hoping to create an app that can keep track of profit and loss statements as well as upload proof of profit and loss. This is a great start!

## How to Run:  
Simply open the page and input data as needed.

## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I plan on making this a full app with the primary intent for independent contractors to save info needed for taxes. The goal is to open the app to today's date (or whatever date you want to add input) and be able to add How Much you were paid, How you were paid(cash, paypal, check etc) Any Contact Info you want to save (driver, helper, customer etc), make custom input boxes, and it will store it all in this app so that all you have to do is input the data you want to save for that date and you users will have access to all the info needed for tax purposes. You can upload and access receipts, banking statements, paypal cashapp venmo etc. I have a lot of goals with this project!
